 Functions are actually special cases of closures.
 
 - Global functions: closures that have a name and do not capture any values.
 - Nested functions: closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.
 - Closure: unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.
